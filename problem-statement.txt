Create model which is work as an assitent for my custom database table schema to reply the generic answers from openai free model based on RAG model.

Example workflow -> lets assume we have an employee database with schema (database/customGPT-schema.pdf) stored. Now if use asked a question to model that "give me the count how may employees who are from Australia?" then my model should create and a result and give that result to GPT and give the summiried answered on the bases of that result. 

The data should be secure and the application should use RAG from my local not cloud but it can use openai API's.

It should be chat based system which have chat history based on account and it will use MySql and Python flask.
 
for frontend you can use Bootstart and javascript/jquery.

output should look like professional assume you have 10 years of experience in development 

also give me the documentaion in .md file with installation steps
